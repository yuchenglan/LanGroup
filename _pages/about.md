Welcome to Lan's Group! This is a cutting-edge research group consisting of faculties and students of physics, mathematics, biology, and engineering.  We are synthesizing and characterizating functional materials, fabricating devices and doing instrumentation, collecting data and analyzing experimental phenomena, to explore the advanced materials and apply them on renewable energy, unique sensors, and green enironments.
