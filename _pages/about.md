Welcome to Lan's Group! 

A cutting-edge research group consisting of faculties and students of physics, mathematics, biology, and engineering dedicated to synthesizing and characterizating functional materials, fabricating devices and doing instrumentation, collecting data and analyzing experimental phenomena, to explore advanced materials and photon / electron / phonon transport, focuing on renewable energies, novel sensors, and green enironments.
