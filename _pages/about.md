Welcome to Lan's Group! This is a cutting-edge research group consisting of faculties and students from physics, mathematics, biology,  and engineering. We are synthesizing and characterizating structured materials, fabricating devices and doing instrumentation, collecting data and analyzing experimental phenomena, to explore advanced materials and their applications on renewable energy, unique sensors, and green enironments.
