Dr. Yucheng Lan is a tenured associate professor of Physics and Engineering Physics, Director of Nano Material Lab, and Director of the Radiation Lab at Morgan State University.  Dr. Lan received his BS degree in Solid State Physics from Jilin University in 1995 and PhD degree in Condensed Mater Physics from Institute Physics Chinease Academy of Sciences in 1998.  He worked in Chinease Academy of Sciences, Temple University, Michigan State Univeristy, Boston College, and the University of Houston and the Texas Center for Superconductivity (TcSUH) before joined in the School of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences at Morgan State Univeristy in 2014.  Dr. Lan leads a Department of Energy (DOE)-funded program to develope high-temperature thermal sensors.  His research has been financially supported by ARL, DOE, DoED, DTRA, NSF, universities and companies.  Dr. Lan has published 150+ peer-reviewed scientific publications with a total citation of 15,000+ times with an h-index of 44 and i10-index of 99.  He is the author of one book and 12 book chapters, editor of two books, guest-editor of two peer-reviewed journals, and inventor of 10+ issued patents.  He is the Task Group Chairman of the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) and reviewer of 40+ international peer-reviewed journals.  His research interests focus on inorganic functional materials and their applications in reneable energy and sensing.
